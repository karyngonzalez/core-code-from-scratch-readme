## Algorithm Of Making a Vegetarian Pizza
1. Get a pre-made pizza dough. (or make your own)
2. Massage the dough until it's soft.
3. Get a rolling pin.
4. Flatten the dough in a circle shape.
5. Put the pizza dough in the pan.
6. Add tomato pizza sauce.
7. Are you lactose intolerent? *(Yes, go to next step and skip step 9) (No, go to step 8)*
8. Add soy cheese.
9. Add mozzarella and cheddar cheese.
10. Are you Vegetarian? *(Yes, skip step 11) (No, go to next step)*
11. Add pepperoni.
12. Heat the Oven at 350 Fahrenheit. 
13. Insert the Pizza inside the oven.
14. Take out the pizza from the oven. **CAUTION: HOT**
15. Put the pizza on a pizza tray.
16. Cut into 8 equal pieces.
18. Add condiments. *(Yes, Add condiments) (No, Go to step 19)*
19. Serve on a nice plate.
20. Enjoy your meal.
## Algorithm to Find Temperature 
1. You should know the temperature scales are *Celsius* and *Fahrenheit*.
2. Read the temperature given in order to make the correct conversion.
3. If you want to find a **Celsius** temperature from Fahrenheit, the formula is:  
*     °C = 5/9 x (°F - 32)
4. If you want to find a **Fahrenheit** temperature from Celsius, the formula is:  
*     °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
5. Give the correct answer.
## Algorithm Finding Formulas of Volume
1. Read which of the volumes you are require to look for and understand what is the purpose of each of them.
2. If you are ask to find *Volume of Pyramid* this is the formula: Volume of pyramid = (1/3) (Bh), where
* 		B = Area of the base of the pyramid
* 		h = Height of the pyramid (which is also called "altitude")
3. If you are ask to find *Volume of a Cube* this is the formula: Volume = a3, where 	
* 		a = Is the length of its sides or edges.
4. If you are ask to find *Volume of the Sphere* this is formula: 4/3 πr3 where, 
* 		r = Is the radius in centimeters.
5. Give the correct answer. 
## Numbers 
1. Authenticate the number and call it ‘authenticate_number’.
2. If a number is even you are able to divide it into 2 with no decimals.
3. Verify if ‘authenticate_number' can be divided by 2.
4. If it can be divided, then: 
*      Print that ‘authenticate_number' is even.
5. If it cannot be divided exactly by 2, then:
*       Print that 'authenticate_number' is odd.
6. End.

## Date Of Birth 
1. Ask for the date of birth and call it 'date_of_birth’.
2. Calculate in which year we are currently right now and call it 'present_year'.
3. Then substract ‘present_year' from the ’date_of_birth’ in order to get the age.
4. Calculate as: 'age' =  'present_year' - 'date_of_birth'.
5. Print the result calculated age.
6. End.
## Find The Treasure 
First statement to take in consideration is that all of the messages are lies, so the following is implicit according to each person’s logic: 

The middle chest doesn’t have a treasure as it is stated in the beginning that it has. It is also stated that all the chests have treasures, indicating that not all of them have treasures. The last statement indicates that only one of this chests have treasure, stipulating more than one has a treasure. 

*Conclusion: A and C have a treasure.*
## Logic Problem 
First Alice stated that nobody and not even her studied mathematics making her the lier, and becoming the statement true, that nobody studied but only her, but this is not possible, so we leave her aside. Bob, stated that one person studied make this a truth, but the other 3 persons stated that 2, 3 and 4 people have studied but *its is not logically possible* so Bob must be telling the truth. 

*Conclusion: Bob told the truth.*
## Cereal Vs. Milk
1. Open box of cereal.
2. Get out a bowl.
3. Pour cereal out of the box directly into the bowl.
4. Stop pouring once bowl is halfway full.
5. Add fruit (If not, skip and go to step 6).
6. Get milk out of the fridge.
7. Pour milk directly into bowl of cereal.
8. Stop pouring once cereal has reached the top of the bowl.
9. Enjoy.
